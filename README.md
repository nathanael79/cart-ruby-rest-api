How to use this REST API

Things you may want to cover:

- clone to your local repository
- run bundle install to install the libraries
- configure your db setting at config/database.yml
- after you configure your db and doesnt create one, you can use `rails db:create` or you can just directly migrate `rails db:migrate`
- use `rails db:seed` for seed your database with existing data
- run the application using `rails s` or `rails s -p {port-number}`, for the default it will run at port `3000`
